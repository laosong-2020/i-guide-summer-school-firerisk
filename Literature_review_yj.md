   * input variables: road density, vegetation type, elevation, topography, road density

### 4. Housing Arrangement and Location Determine the Likelihood of Housing Loss Due to Wildfire 
(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033954)
   * input variables: community at risk, area of the neighborhood, distance to nearest housing/building, housing dispersion, fire frequency, distance to the coast

### 5. Estimating Future Residential Property Risk Associated with Wildfires in Louisiana, U.S.A.

  * input variables: property value, population

### 6. The distributional incidence of wildfire hazard in the western United States
(https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac60d7/meta)
  * input variables: Per capita income, Percent below poverty line, Percent white (non-Hispanic), Percent Native American, Percent over 65, housing value

### 7. The Economics of Wildfire in the United States (https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-resource-111920-014804)
  * Local wildfire education programs are an important factor in reducing wildfire
  * Fuel treatment prescribed burning can reduce wildfire
  * home insurance plans can cause economic loss
  * structure proximity to fuels and lower structure density are associated with an increased probability of structure loss (Caggiano et al., 2020)

# Study site
 ### 1. Increasing trends of drought
 - A prolonged summer in Texas, resulting in repetitive droughts, affects more than 80% of the state and contributes to wildfire (Vu, 2023). According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, nearly 40% of Texas is experiencing extreme or exceptional drought in 2024. Climate change is expected to increase drought severity, which will further exacerbate the risk of wildfires.

 ### 2. Substantial number of minorities and elderly
 - Including Hispanic or Latino, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans. Moreover, individuals aged 65 and older make up around 12% to 14% of the total population in Texas. The number of residents aged 65 and older in Texas has been increasing steadily.
 

# Significance of our research
- fire can directly impact people by posing an immediate threat to life, property, and local economies (Milne et al. 2014). Beyond these direct effects, fire can influence behavior as people evacuate or simply try to avoid smoke exposure (McCaffrey et al. 2018). In 2020, damages from wildfire totaled US$16.5 billion in the United States, with more than 10,000 structures damaged or destroyed in California alone (NOAA 2021).
Texas is average of $2.0-$5.0 Billion-dollar loss annulay due to wildfire.

- While many studies focus on agricultural economic loss, fewer studies examine the economic impact of property loss.
- Utilization of innovative datasets that describe more detailed environmental factors prone to wildfire (e.g., limited studies have considered climate variables and environmental factors such as fuel disturbance in their analysis, with most studies utilizing vegetation or land use data). 
- Employing multiple machine learning methods to understand the uncertainty and discrepancies among models.
