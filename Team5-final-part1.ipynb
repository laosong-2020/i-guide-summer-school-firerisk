    "* Wildfire trends globally and in the United States </p>\n",
    "As a natural phenomenon, wildfires pose substantial economic consequences, and their management is fraught with complexities, dynamic challenges, and incentive problems. \n",
    "Fire can directly impact people by posing an immediate threat to life, property, and local economies (Milne et al., 2014). Beyond these direct effects, fire can influence behavior as people evacuate or try to avoid smoke exposure (McCaffrey et al., 2018). Wildfires damage about \n",
    "3.3 billion dollars annually in the United States.\n",
    "In 2020, wildfire damages totaled US 16.5 billion dollars in the United States, with over 10,000 structures damaged or destroyed in California alone (NOAA 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why Texas?</p>\n",
    "Understanding the economic impact of wildfires is crucial, particularly in regions like Texas, where the frequency and intensity of wildfires have been increasing. A prolonged summer in Texas, resulting in repetitive droughts, affects more than 80% of the state and contributes to wildfires (Vu, 2023). According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, nearly 40% of Texas is experiencing extreme or exceptional drought in 2024. Climate change is expected to increase drought severity, further exacerbating wildfire risk. Texas has an average loss of 2.0-5.0 billion dollars annually due to wildfires in 2020.\n",
    "Moreover, 5683 structures were destroyed, and 372 were destroyed between 2005 and 2003 (Headwaters Economics, 2024). Recent wildfires in Texas have caused extensive property damage, leading to substantial economic losses for local communities—wildfire. The  Bastrop County, Texas Complex fire in 2011 destroyed over 1,600 homes and caused an estimated 325 million dollars in property damage ((Economic Development Corporation). Such events underscore the importance of developing effective wildfire management strategies that consider the economic implications.\n",
    " \n",
    "* Wildfire impact varies according to sociodemograph</p>\n",
    "Studies have found that the elderly population is among the most vulnerable. Individuals aged 65 and older make up around 12% to 14% of the total population in Texas. The number of residents aged 65 and 4,102 retirees moving to Texas in 2024 indicates that the older population in Texas is expected to grow more\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose of this study</p>\n",
    "This study aims to synthesize existing economic research on wildfires better to understand their scale, trends, and management phases. By doing so, we aim to highlight the economic interdependencies and spillover effects that create inefficiencies and justify public institutional responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contribution of this research </p>\n",
    "While many studies focus on agricultural economic loss, fewer studies examine the economic impact of property loss. This study utilized innovative datasets that describe more detailed environmental factors prone to wildfire (e.g., limited studies have considered climate variables and environmental factors such as fuel disturbance in their analysis, with most studies utilizing vegetation or land use data). Moreover, this study employed multiple machine learning methods to understand the uncertainty and discrepancies among models.\n",
